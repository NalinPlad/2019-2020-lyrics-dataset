Oh, oh-oh
Oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)


I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more


Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rock star
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more


Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy

We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feeling heat in December when you're 'round me

I've been dancing on top of cars
And stumbling out of bars
I follow you through the dark
Can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain
The tattoo inside my brain
And baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take you know that you'll find me

No one knows about you (About you)
About you (About you)
And you're making the typical me
Break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you

Yeah
Don't complicate it, yeah
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember
All of the nights I don't remember when you're 'round me

I've been dancing on top of cars
And stumbling out of bars

Can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain
The tattoo inside my brain

I've been having dreams
Jumping on a trampoline
Flipping in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to falling leaves
Now they're right upon me

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I've been having dreams
Splashing in a summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushing weight of paradise
Solid block of gold
Lying in the cold
I feel right at home

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I never feel so loved

La la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest

It might have been a nightmare
To anyone who might care

Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the golden
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed

I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
"They don't deserve you"

I tried to scream
But my head was under water
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter

Could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
"They don't deserve you"

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
(Six minutes, six minutes)
Something's wrong, I can feel it
(Six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen
But I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble
Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say
I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
With this rappity brat
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop "F" bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period
Here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bust a rhyme'
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game
'Til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay-looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay
That's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You're rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep-throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes
But sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to
Censor you like that one line I said
On "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line
Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now
That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel
With fucking cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
While he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
Ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music
You make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do
When they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop."
'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
Unghh, school flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
When I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still "Chunky, but Funky"
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and
Here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons
Make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king?
Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

Baby, you've been so distant from me lately
And lately don't even wanna call you "baby"

Saw us getting older
Burning toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like

It feels like you don't care
Oh, why don't you recognize I'm so rare?
Always there
You don't do the same for me
That's not fair

I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I'm special, yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare, to make me feel rare

Baby, don't make me count up all the reasons
To stay with you
No reason why you and I are not succeeding
Uh uh

Saw us getting older
Burning toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high (Too high)
Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like

It feels like you don't care
Oh, why don't you recognize I'm so rare?
Always there
You don't do the same for me
That's not fair

I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I'm special, yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare, to make me feel rare (Yeah, yeah)

I'm not gonna beg for you
I'm not gonna let you make me cry (Make me cry)
Not getting enough from you
Didn't you know I'm hard to find? (Hard to find)

Saw us getting older
Burning toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high (too high)
Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like

It feels like you don't care
Why don't you recognize I'm so rare? (So rare)
I'm always there
You don't do the same for me
That's (That's)
Not (Not)
Fair

I don't have it all (I don't have it all)
I'm not claiming to (I'm not claiming to)
I know that I'm special, yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare, to make me feel rare
Oh yeah

So rare
(Rare)
(Rare)

Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?

All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
Cuz this one's pretty nice
Living it up

Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?

All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

Hold on just a little tighter
Come on
Hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on
Baby keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on
Hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on
Baby keep on dancing
Let's get physical

All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

(Physical, Physical)

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man, then I'd be the man

Angel, with the gun in your hand
Pointin' my direction
Givin' me affection
Love is fatal
Won't you give it a chance?
Center of attention
Don't you ask me any questions

Go on and light me like a cigarette
Even if it might be something you regret
You got me now, now, now
Swallow me down, down, down, down

I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and calling it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

Lay me in the palm of your hand
I'll give you my permission
You'll always be forgiven
Go on, replace me
When you're craving something sweeter than the words I left in your mouth
Go on and spit me out

I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough
And no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changing my face and calling it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

I love the way you're screaming my name

I love the way you're screaming my name

Go on and light me like a cigarette
Even if it might be something you regret
You got me now, now, now
Swallow me down, down, down, down

I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough
And no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changing my face and calling it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

I love the way you're screaming my name

I love the way you're screaming my name

Who knows how long
I've been awake now?
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning...
Who knows what's right?
The lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on

There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]
There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]

Below my soul
I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out
I've come too far
To see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
I keep pushing on and on and on and on

There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...[2x]
There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]

I keep falling, I keep falling down...
I keep falling, I keep falling down...
Hey!
I keep falling, I keep falling down...
I keep falling, I keep falling down...
If you could only save me
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul

There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]
There's nothing left to say now... [2x]
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now... [2x]

You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this crying
Nobody's gonna heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me

Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now

'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah yeah (Ooh ooh)
Hey yeah yeah (Ooh ooh)
Hey yeah yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah yeah (Ooh ooh)
Hey yeah yeah (Ooh ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah yeah (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh...)

Now it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late
Or could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you (Even if I break in two)

Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now

'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah yeah (Ooh ooh)
Hey yeah yeah (Ooh ooh)
Hey yeah yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah yeah (Ooh ooh)
Hey yeah yeah (Ooh ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah yeah (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh...)

I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh...

I want your stupid love, love (Oh, oh, woo)
We got a stupid love, love
(Oh...)
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh...)
I want your stupid love, love

(Yeah, we all make mistakes
Yeah, here's some of mine)
Yeah, it's my life
Lord forgive me (c'mon)
For the way I'm livin'
(I'm a sinner man, all of us are)
Lord forgive me
For the way I'm livin' (yeah)

Lord forgive me, I know I've made a lot of mistakes
When you look at my face you can tell I'm ready to break
Ready to snap, lost, where am I at?
I keep looking for light but why am I in the black
It's invisible I've been mixing and twisting the principles
There I go talking 'bout my life, how it's miserable
It's pitiful I live in this prison I been in through
Tryin' to minister when I'm the one that needs to be ministered to
Lord forgive me
I don't know why I do this
I betray you stab you in the back like Judas
Like Peter I deny you, like I don't know
Tears running down my face as the rooster crows
I'm a liar living in a world of 'em
I'm dyin' sins starting to fill my lungs
Oh no, I can hear the devil of my head
Great, Nate it looks like you're doin' circles again

It's like my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell
[x2]

I wake up in the morin'
My minds on me
Never said a prayer, Lord, never even noticed
Why am I so open to blaming when I'm broke
The moment I feel fine, I let the door close
Dealing with insecurity but not about myself
I'm having a hard time trusting anyone else
I treat you like a toy
So I put you on the shelf
Like I'll come play later if I need any help
And yeah I think you're calling but I don't really hear you
Seems I should be concerned with what I see in the mirror
What I see in the mirror's more than my appearance
I see anger eating away at my spirit
And maybe I should change, but I don't really want to
Unless I feel pain it's like I don't really want you
I know, by now it seems like I'd be smarter
The worst part is, now I'm right back where I started

It's like my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell
[x2]

Father please, I know I don't deserve your grace
None of us do, yet, your mercy remains
You were perfect, there I go running away with nothing to say
Lord, I'm ready to change
Take me, and mold me into something that's right
Sick of living my life like
Like I'm out of your light, I'm out of your sight
I need you to charge in
Take me out the darkness
And wrap me in your arms cause
Without you I'm just another phony
And without you it's like I don't even know me, show me
Pull me in the right direction
Need your life protection
Need the mic directed
I'm sick of living life like I ain't gotta have you
When in the end we both know that I have to
It's sad too
'Cause every time I'm falling away
I can hear the little voice inside my head say

It's my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell
[x2]

I'm not a bad guy
So don't treat me bad if I'm feeling sad, alright?
Please don't be mad if I don't smile back, alright?
If I fuck up my words, don't think I'm absurd, alright?
Alright?

I'm physically exhausted
Tired of my knuckles beating
I'm chewing gum to pass this time
Sadness, can't you see it?
You're too busy seeking selfish wishes
Don't care how I'm feeling
You write me up and say it's love
And I can't believe it

Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention

De-detention
De-detention
Pretending everything's all right is... (shh)

The teachers don't care 'bout me
Fuck how I feel, as long as I make money
They let them do whatever they want to me
They're the customer, I'm chopped meat
I'm chopped meat

I'm physically exhausted
Tired of my knuckles beating
I'm chewing gum to pass this time
Sadness, can't you see it?
You're too busy seeking selfish wishes
Don't care how I'm feeling
You write me up and say it's love
And I can't believe it

Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention

De-detention
De-detention
Pretending everything's all right is detention

I wanna go home and you say, "Now is not the time"
Fuck being all alone in the back of the classroom, ah
Stop calling up my phone, trying to say that I've been out of line
When all I ever asked was to go to the bathroom

Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention

Tonight, I can feel your blood pressure rise
Let me crawl up into your mind
Pretending everything's alright (Is detention)

I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But, I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost

I got four red bottoms up in flames at my place now
I burned three Chanel dresses, three words we don't say now
And it's hard not to drink when it's the one thing I think about
It's a lot of spiders in the attic, I don't mean to be dramatic
But I think it's kinda tragic who we magically became now

I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But, I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost

Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost

Yeah
Tell me what I'm supposed to do with all these pictures on my iPhone
Even all them videos, only you and I know
You never cared about me, you just care about the likes though
Every time you pop up, you should see my fuckin' eye roll
I can't even kick it with the homies that we both know
I can't even fuck with any places that we used to go
Now all I got is just the memories of us, though
Burn it all down to the ground with your ghost

I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But, I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost

Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost

I wish I could take back summer nights
Erase all the vibes
Leave the memories out to dry
Delete forever, no archive
Take the words you said to me
Hold on to them intentionally
I know that eventually
I'ma set fire to the one thing I loved the most
Burn it all to the ground with your ghost

I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But, I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost

Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost

Sooner or later the lights up above
Will come down in circles and guide me to love
I don't know what's right for me
I cannot see straight
I've been here too long and I don't wanna wait for it

Fly like a cannonball straight to my soul
Tear me to pieces and make me feel whole
I'm willing the fight for it
To feel something new
To know what it's like to be sharing a space with you

Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light

Sooner or later it all comes apart
The walls are all shattered, I'm back at the start
And I'm willing to follow this
Wherever it goes
The heart has its reasons that nobody knows

And I wanna believe in a world we can't see
Millions of particles passing through me
And I know there's a meaning
I feel it, I swear
I can't see the future, but I know that it's there

Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light

With all your light

I close my eyes
And I'm seeing you everywhere
I step outside
It's like I'm breathing you in the air
I can feel you're there

Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light

With all your light

Cry, cry, cry, baby
Cry, cry, cry

In a book about the world
Called The Luminous Things
There are trees and flowers glowing
While Jizo Bodhisattva sings

When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side

(Dum-dum-dum) Don't want us to hurt each other (Dum-dum-dum)
Or cause each other pain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum) Don't want to feel what they don't know (Dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum) We're in this together, baby (Dum-dum-dum)
We're as singing is to rain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
So I'll never, never, ever let you go (Dum-dum-dum)

When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

For your miracles outnumber
All the stars out in the sky

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
